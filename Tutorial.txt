#American presidential debates aren't won on policy.
I've covered six presidential elections and have never seen a debate where one candidate emerged as the winner because they made an outstanding policy proposal.

Sure, the ABC News moderators at Tuesday's debate will ask Donald Trump and Kamala Harris earnest questions about tax cuts and foreign affairs.
But what viewers always focus on are the moments where one candidate has a zinger of a line, or somehow unnerves their opponent, or simply seems more in control.
This is perhaps why an adviser to Trump tells me the former president hasn't spent his prep time brushing up on policy.
Instead, he's been "fine-tuning the theatrics of his performance". If there's one thing that Trump understands well, it's television audiences.
He has also been on a presidential debate stage five times already.
For Kamala Harris, this poses a problem. This is her debut. She has not had much rehearsal time and it's hard to become a world class performer in a couple of weeks.
Unlike her opponent, Ms Harris has spent the past week holed up in a Pennsylvania hotel deep in policy books - but her team has also tried to prepare her to win the optics battle too.
